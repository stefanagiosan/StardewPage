## Stardew Valley Fan Page
This project is a fan page dedicated to the game Stardew Valley, offering fans information about characters, in-game activities and guides. The web application includes an engaging frontend interface and a dynamic backend to handle user interactions.
## Frontend
The frontend is built using HTML and CSS to create a visual interface that mirrors the charming aesthetic of the game, featuring pastel colors, pixelated illustrations, and a minimalist layout that reflects Stardew Valleyâ€™s visual style.
## Backend
On the backend, PHP and JavaScript are used to manage dynamic content and user authentication.
* PHP handles the user login and logout functionality, enabling registered users to log in to their accounts.
* Used javascript for a user registration form with real-time validation and dynamically populated country and city dropdowns.
* Implementation of a table search filter and a "Show More" button to reveal hidden content.
* jQuery for table filtering.
  
 -> Searchable Table:

Real-time filtering of table rows based on user input.
Rows are dynamically shown/hidden as the user types in the search box.


  -> Show More Functionality:

A button that, when clicked, hides a section of content and reveals additional information.
The button is removed after revealing the hidden content.
