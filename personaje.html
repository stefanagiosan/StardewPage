                <tr><th>Friendship</th></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Friendship Mechanics</strong></td><td>Friendship can be earned with Pelican Town's villagers. As friendships deepen, the villagers' dialogue lines become more friendly, cut-scenes called heart events occur, villagers are more likely to send gifts in the mail, and marriage is possible with one of the datable villagers. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Point System</strong></td><td>Each villager has a friendship score represented by a ten-heart meter, except the player's spouse or roommate, who has a fourteen-heart meter. A marriage candidate who has not received a bouquet has the last two hearts grayed out. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Decay</strong></td><td>Each day, not talking to a villager will slightly decrease their friendship unless their heart meter is full. If the player is married, decay never stops with their spouse even if the player is at 14 hearts with them. Calling a villager using the Telephone does not count as talking to the villager. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Gifts</strong></td><td>You can give each villager one gift per day, up to two gifts per week, as indicated by the checkboxes in the social tab. You can review the villager's gift preferences by clicking on their row in the Social Tab to open the "Gift Log". This log keeps track of gifts given, and gift preferences learned via Secret Notes and dialogues with their family and friends. Any previously-given gifts that are currently in inventory will have a blue backpack icon in the lower right. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Heart Events</strong></td><td>Gaining friendship with each villager will unlock unique events. t's possible to permanently miss some events, though most events can be viewed anytime or out of order. In some heart events, it is not possible to increase or decrease friendship with anyone, even if dialogue choices are available. However, in certain heart events, making certain choices can either increase or decrease friendship with certain villagers involved.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Romance</strong></td><td>Some villagers can be romanced by the player. Once the player has reached eight hearts with an eligible villager, the player can give them a bouquet to unlock the ninth and tenth hearts. Once the player has reached ten hearts with an eligible villager, the player can give them a Mermaid's Pendant to propose marriage, which the villager always accepts.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Quests</strong></td><td>The game-opening Introductions quest, when completed, increases by 100 the player's friendship points with each of the 28 starting townspeople.</td></tr>
