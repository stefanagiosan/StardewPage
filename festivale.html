                <tr><th>Festivals</th></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Egg Festival</strong></td><td>The Egg Festival takes place on <strong>the 13th of every Spring.</strong> The player attends the festival by entering Pelican Town Square between 9am and 2pm. When the festival ends, the player is returned to The Farm at 10pm. The featured attraction of the Egg Festival is the Egg Hunt. The player and some other villagers search for small colored eggs hidden around Pelican Town.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Desert Festival</strong></td><td>The Desert Festival takes place in the Desert during <strong>Spring 15-17, from 10am to 2am.</strong> The player does not need to wait for Pam to arrive at the Bus Stop to visit the Desert for the first two days of the festival. There are various rotating stock shops, a race to bet on, challenges to complete for event currency, and a daily opportunity to receive a new outfit from Emily.
                    Like the Night Market, time passes regularly, however villagers will not be at their homes or shops as they will be at the festival. </td></tr>

                    A central feature of the Luau is the potluck soup. Villagers bring different ingredients to prepare this soup for the Governor, who tastes and judges it. The soup-tasting begins by talking to Mayor Lewis.
                    Depending upon the type and quality of the ingredients the player supplies for the soup, there will be different reactions from the Governor and Mayor Lewis. The outcome may increase or reduce friendship points with all villagers.
                    The Luau ends automatically after the Governor tastes the soup. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Trout Derby</strong></td><td>The Trout Derby takes place during <strong>Summer 20-21</strong>  in Cindersap Forest near the river below Marnie's Ranch. It starts at 6:10am and ends at 2am. Players can catch Rainbow Trout all day long. Each Rainbow Trout caught has a chance to give a Golden Tag, which can be exchanged for prizes.
                    Unlike other festivals, shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the Trout Derby, and time continues to pass during the festival.  </td></tr>

                    The festival ends automatically after watching the jellyfish.  </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Stardew Valley Fair</strong></td><td>The Stardew Valley Fair takes place on the <strong>16th of Fall every year.</strong>  The player attends the fair by entering Pelican Town between 9am and 3pm, and upon leaving the festival, is returned to The Farm at 10pm.
                    There are several games where the player can gain Star Tokens, a currency that can be exchanged for prizes at the Shop near the entrance to the Bus Stop.  </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Spirit's Eve</strong></td><td>The Spirit's Eve festival takes place on the <strong>27th of Fall every year.</strong>  The player enters the festival by entering Pelican Town between 10pm and 11:50pm, and upon leaving the festival, is returned to The Farm at 12am.

There's also an Ice Fishing Contest the player can take part in along with Pam, Willy, and Elliott. The player wins if they catch at least five fish. Players are automatically provided with a fishing rod for the duration of the competition. The first win earns the player two tackles, 1 Magnet bait, and a Sailor's Cap. Subsequent years earn the player a Prize Ticket. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>SquidFest</strong></td><td>The SquidFest takes place during <strong>Winter 12-13 on the Beach.</strong>  It starts at 6:10am and ends at 2am. Players can catch Squid all day long. Each day, players can earn copper, iron, gold, and iridium tier prizes depending on how much Squid they caught. Note that the counter for the amount of squids caught will reset on the beginning of the 13th. In addition, the prizes for each day are different.

                    Unlike other festivals, shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the SquidFest, and time continues to pass during the festival. </td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Night Market</strong></td><td>The Night Market takes place during <strong>Winter 15-17, on the Beach, from 5pm-2am.</strong>  The festival features shops, a mermaid show, and a deep-sea fishing submarine where the player can catch unique fish.

                    The main event of the Feast of the Winter Star is secret gift-giving. A random villager will be selected to give the player a gift, and they are assigned a random villager to give a gift to. A week beforehand, on the 18th, Mayor Lewis will send a letter telling the player who their gift recipient is. At the festival, talking to their gift recipient will pop up their inventory to decide gift to give. Upon giving a gift, the recipient will give a response and player's gift-receiving cutscene occurs, where they will find out who is giving them a gift at the festival.
                    
                    The festival ends when the player leaves Pelican Town. </td></tr>
